# Actuators-and-Sensors-in-Robotics
All sketches are for sharing my thoughts.
This code designed to detect only three colors(Red, Green, Blue), took one of the highest value of colors from the serial monitor, and the highest value of color was displayed on LCD and turned on the LED. This color detection sensor is often used in industrial and manufacturing application for quality control. From this exercise, practice the use  of color detection sensor, make the color appear on the LCD, and turn on the LED that matches that color.
